# Configuration

### Data collection & Trading

Modify the `secrets.yaml` file, and add your twitter, reddit, and GDAX API keys. 
This will enable you to programmatically access the twitter and Reddit APIs. Also add your
gdax key, secret, and pass phrase for automated trading. Goes without saying that you should
be very careful with these, and only start live trading when you are sure you won't be losing
money.
